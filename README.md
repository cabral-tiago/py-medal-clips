# py-medal-clips
Discord Bot to automatically post Medal clips from your friends in your discord server. Written in Python with Discord.py.

# Update
Unfortunately, the nature of this bot collides with the API restrictions, getting the API requests blocked after a while. Maybe if Medal provides a better API to handle these events without having to ping their search system for each user seperately and repeatedly, I will be able to update the bot to a stable and working state.
